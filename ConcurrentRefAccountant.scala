/**
 * A generic concurrent registry of reference counts. Keeps track of refCounts
 * to resources and expires them. All operations are thread safe and
 * non-blocking. With the caveat that doDeletions is not reentrant.
 *
 * Notes on thread safety:
 *
 * incRefCount() and decRefCount() update the reference count for a key. When
 * a reference to a key is created for the first time incRefCount will invoke
 * the newRefCb. Symmetrically doDeletions() will invoke deletedRefCb() when
 * a key is finally expired.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Calls to newRefCb and deletedCallsCb will have a happens-before
 * relationship among them. Implementations of the callbacks must preserve
 * this happens-before relationship, meaning that any side effects that
 * newRefCb must be seen by deletedRefCb if called for the same key one after
 * the other. Again, this class guarantees that deletedRefCb will not be called
 * until newRefCb has been called and has returned.
 *
 * Synchronization is lock-less, and this is how the possible races are
 * prevented, most are trivial but explained for completeness:
 *
 *   + At reference creation time
 *      - Two incRefCount() calls could race with each other. This is avoided
 *        by using putIfAbsent() to write to the ref-count map. The loser of
 *        the race will retry the operation through a recursive call.
 *
 *      - decRefCount() is a no-op in this case.
 *
 *   + At reference expiration time
 *      - When decRefCount decrements a count to zero, it will calculate the
 *        expiration time and put it in the expiring queue. Because the counts
 *        could vary (to one and back to zero) in the expiration interval, the
 *        canonical expiration time is kept in the ref count map. The queue
 *        simply marks that a key should be checked or expiration when
 *        doDeletions() is invoked.
 *
 *      - When doDeletions goes through the queue and sees that an entry has
 *        a ref count of zero and is expired, it will atomically set the ref
 *        count to -1, conditional to it being zero. This prevents incRefCount
 *        from racing with doDeletions:
 *
 *          - if incRefCount wins, doDeletions will fail to set the count to -1
 *            and will *not* expire the key.
 *
 *          - incRefCount will in turn, increment the ref-count conditional to
 *            it being larger than -1. If doDeletions wins the race and
 *            the count turns out to be -1 one, the operation is retried
 *            recursively. This will cause incRefCount to eventually find that
 *            the entry has been deleted and it will be treated as a new
 *            ref. Because of this, doDeletion must call deletedRefCb() before
 *            removing the key from the ref count map, it is only then that the
 *            incRefCount retry will succeed, guaranteeing a happens-before
 *            relationship.
